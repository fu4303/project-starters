# Popular Movies - Your all-in-one movies home!

This repo is for a real world example app being built totally in react for the students of Re:Coded's Baghdad Web Development Bootcamp.

Each commit is a new feature being implemented for the project and is added progressively. Please follow the **implemented** branch. The **master** branch will only receive pull requests from the students.




## How to run the project

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

## First run

This project uses [The Movies Database API v3](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) and it requires an API_KEY.

After acquiring an API_KEY from TMDb, duplicate the file `apiKey.example.js` and rename to `apiKey.js`. The new file will be ignored by git. Then add your acquired api key in the new file.
